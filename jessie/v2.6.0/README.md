# Grafana v2.6.0 release for raspberry pi 2
Build from tag [v2.6.0](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/v2.6.0) with
[this](https://github.com/fg2it/phantomjs-on-raspberry/tree/master/jessie/b483dd673a1ca589ff10c5f73dfea1e43bfa3225)
`phantomjs` binary working on raspberry pi 2 running raspbian/jessie.

`go` version was 1.5.2, `nodejs` was 4.4.1, `npm` was 2.14.20 and `phantomjs` was
some version between 2.0.0 and 2.1.0 release
([b483dd6](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/tree/b483dd673a1ca589ff10c5f73dfea1e43bfa3225)).

The packages here can be expected to work on raspbian/wheezy too, except for
features relying on `PhantomJS`.

Should you follow the instructions below with the right binary for PhantomJS,
you would end up with a fully functional build.


## Main problems to overcome
### go
Not really a problem, it is more of a comment. You have two easy ways to get v1.5 :
- First, the easy way with [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm). See [here](https://github.com/fg2it/grafana-on-raspberry/tree/master/wheezy/f27f028d4495e46e9b509704e1fc52dcd2d0b5e8).
- Second, the very easy way with [hypriot](http://blog.hypriot.com/post/how-to-compile-go-on-arm/)
unofficial tarball, which is what I did here. I am not too much in favor of
unofficial build, but hypriot produces a nice and well establish work on arm,
this is a leap of faith I can take. If you can't, hypriot fully explains how to
produce the package yourself. It is a bit more tedious than the `gvm` way, but once
you have the tarball, it is much more easy and efficient to install it.

### nodejs
You need a recent version of `nodejs` (>=0.12.0 should be fine; 0.12.7 is).

Careful here, `npm` (>=3.0.0) changed its way to layout modules and grafana
build rely on this layout at least to find `phantomjs` binary to be included
in the package (see [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v2.6.0/tasks/options/phantomjs.js)
for gory details). 
The following instructions expect the npm v2 layout. You will need to adapt a
few things in the following instructions and probably some grafana source files
(see [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v3.0-beta1/tasks/options/phantomjs.js)).

### phantomjs
You may want to have `phantomjs` since `grafana` relies on it for the feature
creating png files from your graph.

Moreover, having `phantomjs` allows a cleaner build since, otherwise, some tests run at packaging time
will fail. You will have to modify the file `build.go` (look for the arg processing loop in main() and
change `grunt("release")` to `grunt("--force","release")`) to ignore failures.

Unfortunately, there are no official binary of phantomjs available for arm.

### phantomjs/phantomjs-prebuild npm module
The problem for `phantomjs` is that the npm module `phantomjs` (later renamed
`phantomjs-prebuilt`) won't succeed on arm. It tries to install official binaries
which don't exist for arm. If you already have `phantomjs` installed, it checks
its version string against some specific version. 

So, having a having `phantomjs` for your raspberry pi is not enough, it has to
be the right version. Otherwise, the phantomjs npm module will reject it and
fail.

Depending on the grafana version you are trying to build and the npm version you
are using, these issues take different flavors. The following general
workaround seems to works in all the cases :
- simply patch the `phantomjs` binary so it answers `phantomjs -v` accordingly
  to what expect the npm module, so the npm module accepts the binary and
  installs itself properly.
- ensure the phantomjs/phantomjs-prebuild npm module install is right by hand.
  Previously, I suggested to let the npm module fails and "finalize" the install
  of this module by simply creating the missing `location.js` file with the
  right content (see previous version of this README file). Here I suggest to
  install the module by hand afterward.


## Instructions
### Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl git ca-certificates
sudo apt-get install binutils gcc make libc-dev
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev  # for fpm
sudo apt-get install rpm            # for rpmbuild, used indirectly by grafana (call to fpm)
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libicu52 libjpeg62-turbo libpng12-0 # for my phantomjs binary !
```
Install go 1.5.2 from hypriot :
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hypriot/golang-armbuilds/releases/download/v1.5.2/go1.5.2.linux-armv7.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /usr/local
export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH
```
Install nodejs :
```bash
cd /tmp
curl -L https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.4.1/node-v4.4.1-linux-armv7l.tar.xz | tar xfJ  -                                                       && \
mv -t /usr/local/bin     node-v4.4.1-linux-armv7l/bin/*
mv -t /usr/local/include node-v4.4.1-linux-armv7l/include/*
mv -t /usr/local/lib     node-v4.4.1-linux-armv7l/lib/*
mv -t /usr/local/share   node-v4.4.1-linux-armv7l/share/*
```
Install fpm :
```bash
gem install fpm
```
Finally, install your `phantomjs` binary. For example :
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fg2it/phantomjs-on-raspberry/master/jessie/b483dd673a1ca589ff10c5f73dfea1e43bfa3225/phantomjs_2.0.0_armhf.deb -o /tmp/phantomjs_2.0.0_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/phantomjs_2.0.0_armhf.deb
```

### Patch PhantomJS
Here is a way to patch your PhantomJS binary:
```bash
export PHJSOFFSET=$(grep -aboF `phantomjs -v` `which phantomjs`|cut -d':' -f1)
printf "1.9.8\00" | sudo dd of=`which phantomjs` obs=1 seek=${PHJSOFFSET} conv=notrunc
```
Be aware, this is not a specially robust way for at least 2 reasons :
- we expect to find only one match of the version string, and accordingly we use the offset of the first match.
- we expect the original string to be at least as long as the new one.

### Build Grafana
The good news is you mainly have to follow the official
[instructions](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v2.6.0/docs/sources/project/building_from_source.md)
with just a few modifications.
```bash
export GOPATH=/tmp/graf-build
mkdir -p $GOPATH
cd $GOPATH
go get github.com/grafana/grafana
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/grafana/grafana
git checkout v2.6.0
go run build.go setup    
$GOPATH/bin/godep restore   
npm install
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/grafana/grafana
```

Before building and packaging, ensure phantomjs npm module install is right
```bash
cd `npm ls --parse phantomjs`
node install.js
```

Finally,
```bash
go run build.go build package
```
The packages are in `./dist`
