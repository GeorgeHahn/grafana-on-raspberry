# Grafana v2.6.0 release for raspberry pi 2
Build from tag [v2.6.0](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/v2.6.0) with with
[this](https://github.com/fg2it/phantomjs-on-raspberry/tree/master/wheezy/2.0.1-development)
`phantomjs` binary working on raspberry pi 2 running raspbian/wheezy.

`go` version was 1.5.2, `nodejs` was 4.4.1, `npm` was 2.14.20 and `phantomjs` was
2.0.1-dev.

The packages here can be expected to work on raspbian/jessie too, except for
features relying on `PhantomJS`. (see [here](https://github.com/fg2it/grafana-on-raspberry/tree/master/jessie/v2.6.0) for jessie)


## Do it your self

Packages were built following the same [instructions](https://github.com/fg2it/grafana-on-raspberry/tree/master/jessie/v2.6.0)
than for jessie with minimal changes. 

### Dependencies
Due to a different `phantomjs` binary, you should have instead of the last `apt-get`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libicu48 libjpeg8 libpng12-0
```
(to be specific, these are the dependencies for my binary).
To install `phantomjs`, can you use my binary :
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fg2it/phantomjs-on-raspberry/master/wheezy/2.0.1-development/phantomjs_2.0.1-development_armhf.deb -o /tmp/phantomjs_2.0.1-development_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i phantomjs_2.0.1-development_armhf.deb
```

The remaining (other dependencies, patch of phantomjs and grafana build) is unchanged.
